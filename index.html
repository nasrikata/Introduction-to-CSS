Step 1: Fork it for yourself.

Step 2: Add semantic HTML elements. 

Remember semantics help add meaning to the website:

<h1> through <h6> 
<p>
<header>
<footer>
<nav>
<a>
<section>
<address>

You don't have add any css for now, we will learn that soon.  

Step 3: Once you add all the tags to the document, you're done with the html portion.  

Note: Copy the link of this pen and paste it in the daily reflection form.

  <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p> 
  
  <p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
